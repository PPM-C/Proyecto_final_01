# Circle Agency Projects

## 🌐 Project Overview: Cicle Agency Website

As the developer for this project, I built a modern, static web application for **Cicle Agency** to showcase their portfolio, promote services, and enable client contact.

The primary goal of this project was to design and develop a **responsive**, **modern website** that effectively showcases the agency’s portfolio, details its services, and simplifies client communication. The result is a **clean**, **high-performance web application** made up of three main pages, each connected through shared resources and integrated with select external services to extend functionality without overcomplicating the stack.

I focused on **responsive design**, **dynamic content loading**, and **clean architecture**, ensuring fast performance and scalability.

## 📱 Responsive Design Strategy

The application follows a **mobile-first** responsive design approach to ensure optimal performance and usability across all devices.

- **Breakpoints:** `1200px`, `870px`, `770px`
- **Navigation:** Hamburger menu for smaller viewports
- **Grid Systems:** Built with CSS Grid; column layout adjusts at breakpoints
- **Typography:** Scalable font sizes for consistent readability on all screens
